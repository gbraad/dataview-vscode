# vscode-dataview README

This project is an attempt to port the [obisidian-dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) project over to an extension for Visual Studio Code. The goal: to enable a query language to search over a collection of markdown files and provide enhanced data insights about the collection.

Development will most likely be very slow on this project as I am a single dev working on this (currently) and am unfamiliar with the Obsidian API.

If you are interested in helping out then feel free to reach out and contact me.
